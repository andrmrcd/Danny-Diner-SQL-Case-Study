# Danny's Diner SQL Case Study



## Introduction

Hello! As part of my learning journey for SQL, I took on the #8weekSQLchallenge by Danny Ma. This repo contains my solution based on MS SQL server to the first case study of the challenge. 
<br><br> This case study covers the following SQL topics:

- Common Table Expressions
- Group By Aggregates
- Window Functions for ranking
- Table Joins


For more details about the challenge, visit their [website](https://8weeksqlchallenge.com/case-study-1/). 



## Problem Statement
Danny seriously loves Japanese food so in the beginning of 2021, he decides to embark upon a risky venture and opens up a cute little restaurant that sells his 3 favourite foods: sushi, curry and ramen.

Danny wants to use the data to answer a few simple questions about his customers, especially about their visiting patterns, how much money theyâ€™ve spent and also which menu items are their favourite. Having this deeper connection with his customers will help him deliver a better and more personalised experience for his loyal customers.
<br>
He plans on using these insights to help him decide whether he should expand the existing customer loyalty program - additionally he needs help to generate some basic datasets so his team can easily inspect the data without needing to use SQL.

Danny has provided you with a sample of his overall customer data due to privacy issues - but he hopes that these examples are enough for you to write fully functioning SQL queries to help him answer his questions!

Danny has shared with you 3 key datasets for this case study:

* sales <br>
* menu <br>
* members <br>

Entity relationship diagram is as follows:

## Case Study Questions
---

**1. What is the total amount each customer spent at the restaurant?**
 ```
	   SELECT 
		   customer_id as Customer, 
		   CONCAT('$ ', SUM(price)) as Total_Spent
	   FROM dbo.sales sal
	   JOIN dbo.menu mnu
		   ON sal.product_id = mnu.product_id
	   GROUP BY customer_id
 ```

**2. How many days has each customer visited the restaurant?**
```
	SELECT

**3. What was the first item from the menu purchased by each customer?**
```
	SELECT

	JOIN(
		SELECT customer_id, min(order_date) as first_order_date
		FROM sales

		AND s.order_date = fo.first_order_date;
```
![3](QueryOutputs/3.png)
---
**4. What is the most purchased item on the menu and how many times was it purchased by all customers?**
```
	SELECT TOP 1 
		m.product_name, 
		COUNT(*) AS purchase_count
	FROM sales s
	JOIN menu m ON s.product_id = m.product_id
	GROUP BY m.product_name
	ORDER BY purchase_count DESC;
```
![4](QueryOutputs/4.png)

**5. Which item was the most popular for each customer?**
```
	SELECT 
		customer_id, 
		product_name, 
		purchase_count
	FROM (
		SELECT 
			s.customer_id, m.product_name, COUNT(*) AS purchase_count,
			RANK() OVER (PARTITION BY s.customer_id ORDER BY COUNT(*) DESC) as rnk
		FROM sales s
		JOIN  menu m
			ON s.product_id = m.product_id
		GROUP BY s.customer_id, m.product_name ) as subquery
	WHERE rnk = 1;

```
![5](QueryOutputs/5.png)

**6. Which item was purchased first by the customer after they became a member?**
```
	with cte as (
		SELECT 
			s.customer_id, 
			m.product_name, 
			order_date, 
			ROW_NUMBER() OVER (PARTITION BY s.customer_id ORDER BY order_date DESC) as rn
		FROM sales s
		JOIN menu m
			ON s.product_id = m.product_id
		JOIN members mem
			ON mem.customer_id = s.customer_id
		WHERE s.order_date > mem.join_date)

	SELECT customer_id, product_name, order_date
	FROM cte
	WHERE rn = 1;
```
![6](QueryOutputs/6.png)
---
**7. Which item was purchased just before the customer became a member?**
```
	WITH BFR as (
		SELECT 
			s.customer_id, 
			m.product_name, 
			s.order_date,
			ROW_NUMBER() OVER (PARTITION BY s.customer_id ORDER BY order_date DESC) as rn
		FROM sales s
		JOIN menu m
			ON s.product_id = m.product_id
		JOIN members mem
			ON s.customer_id = mem.customer_id
		WHERE s.order_date < join_date) 

	SELECT customer_id, product_name, order_date
	FROM BFR
	WHERE rn = 1;
```
![7](QueryOutputs/7.png)
---
**8. What is the total items and amount spent for each member before they became a member?**
```
	SELECT 
		s.customer_id, 
		COUNT(*) as total_items, 
		SUM(m.price) as total_spent
	FROM sales s
	JOIN menu m
		ON s.product_id = m.product_id
	JOIN members mem
		ON s.customer_id = mem.customer_id
	WHERE order_date < join_date
	GROUP BY s.customer_id;
```

**9. If each $1 spent equates to 10 points and sushi has a 2x points multiplier -** 
**   how many points would each customer have?**
```
	SELECT 
		customer_id,
		SUM(CASE 
			WHEN product_name = 'sushi' THEN (price*20)
			ELSE (price*10)
		END) as total_points
	FROM sales s
	JOIN menu m
		ON s.product_id = m.product_id
	GROUP BY customer_id;
```

**10. In the first week after a customer joins the program (including their join date) **
**    they earn 2x points on all items, not just sushi. How many points do customer A and B have at the end of January?**
```
	SELECT 
		s.customer_id,
		SUM(CASE
			WHEN order_date BETWEEN join_date AND DATEADD(week,1,join_date) THEN m.price*20
			ELSE m.price*10
			END) AS total_points
	FROM sales s
	JOIN menu m
		ON s.product_id = m.product_id
	JOIN members mem
		ON s.customer_id = mem.customer_id
	WHERE DATEPART(MONTH,s.order_date) = 1
		AND DATEPART(DAY,s.order_date) <= 31 
	GROUP BY s.customer_id;
```

## Bonus Questions
## Join All The Tables
---
```
	SELECT 
		s.customer_id,
		s.order_date,
		m.product_name,
		m.price,
		CASE 
			WHEN order_date >= join_date THEN 'Y'
			ELSE 'N'
			END as member
	FROM sales s
	JOIN menu m
		ON s.product_id = m.product_id
	LEFT JOIN members mem
		ON s.customer_id = mem.customer_id;
```

## Rank All The Things <br>
Danny also requires further information about the ranking of customer products, but he purposely does not need the ranking for non-member purchases so he expects null ranking values for the records when customers are not yet part of the loyalty program.
```
	WITH CTE1 AS (SELECT 
			s.customer_id,
			s.order_date,
			m.product_name,
			m.price,
			CASE 
				WHEN order_date >= join_date THEN 'Y'
				ELSE 'N'
				END as member
		FROM sales s
		JOIN menu m
			ON s.product_id = m.product_id
		LEFT JOIN members mem
			ON s.customer_id = mem.customer_id)

	SELECT 
		customer_id,
		order_date,
		product_name,
		price,
		member,
		CASE 
			WHEN member = 'Y' THEN ROW_NUMBER() OVER (PARTITION BY member ORDER BY order_date ASC)
			ELSE NULL
		END as Ranking
	FROM CTE1
	ORDER BY customer_id, order_date
```
