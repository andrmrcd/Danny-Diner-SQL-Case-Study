# Danny's Diner SQL Case Study



## Introduction

Hello! As part of my learning journey for SQL, I took on the #8weekSQLchallenge by Danny Ma. This repo contains my solution to the first case study of the challenge. For more details, visit their [website](https://8weeksqlchallenge.com/case-study-1/) 


## Problem Statement
Danny seriously loves Japanese food so in the beginning of 2021, he decides to embark upon a risky venture and opens up a cute little restaurant that sells his 3 favourite foods: sushi, curry and ramen.

Danny wants to use the data to answer a few simple questions about his customers, especially about their visiting patterns, how much money theyâ€™ve spent and also which menu items are their favourite. Having this deeper connection with his customers will help him deliver a better and more personalised experience for his loyal customers.
<br>
He plans on using these insights to help him decide whether he should expand the existing customer loyalty program - additionally he needs help to generate some basic datasets so his team can easily inspect the data without needing to use SQL.

Danny has provided you with a sample of his overall customer data due to privacy issues - but he hopes that these examples are enough for you to write fully functioning SQL queries to help him answer his questions!

Danny has shared with you 3 key datasets for this case study:

* sales <br>
* menu <br>
* members <br>
